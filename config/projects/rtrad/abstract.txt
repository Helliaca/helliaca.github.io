RTRad is an enhanced implementation of progressive refinement radiosity using Nvidia's RTX technology to accelerate visibility calculations.
<br>
The project is built on Falcor 4.4 and contains a highly configureable pipeline. GI lightmaps can be generated in a variety of different ways and individual data components can easily be visualized. Custom scenes and models can be defined and loaded into the rendering environment using the .pyscene format.

The development took place as part of a Masters's thesis at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin.
