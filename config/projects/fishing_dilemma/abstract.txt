As a follow-up study on both CoinScrounge and the ProducerScroungers Minecraft study, we sought to reduce and simplify the concept by narrowing down options and movement without removing the continous timescale. The Fishing Dilemma gives the player only one possible input option: to switch ponds. Despite the simple premise, the implementation of this experiment was valuable and enriching for my progression as a software developer. Reason being that I decided to implement the entire netcode from scratch. The experiment is effectively built on a network-synchronized C# dictionary, letting the clients interpret it's contents and display the current gamestate to the participant.
