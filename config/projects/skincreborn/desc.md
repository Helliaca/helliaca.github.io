I programmed Skinc Reborn all the way back in 2014, before I even started studying computer science. It was an ambitous project, including a fully fledged single-player campaign/gauntlet, destructible terrain and an interactie tutorial.

I used SFML for the underlying 2D graphics and WinForms for the menu-system. Albeit a little rough around the edges, this project taught me a lot about game engines, graphics and so much more!
