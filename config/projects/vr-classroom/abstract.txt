Teacher trainees at the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/" alt="link to uni potsdam">University of Potsdam</a> possess strong pedagogical knowledge, yet often lack sufficient opportunities to practice classroom management in a low-stakes environment.<br><br>This VR Classroom application aims to bridge that gap by simulating an immersive school setting populated by intelligent, interactive students. Powered by integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) with seamless Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech modules, the system enables natural verbal interaction on standard hardware, allowing educators to build confidence before stepping into a real classroom.
