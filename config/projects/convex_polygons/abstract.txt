A convex partition of a pointset consists of a planar subdivision of its convex hull so that all faces are empty and convex.  Finding a partition with the minimum amount of edges (or faces), is still a problem of unknown complexity. <br>
As part of the <a href="https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/competition/cg-shop-2020/#problem-description">CG:SHOP 2020</a> competition we devised a set of four different algorithms to compute various convex partitions for differently arranged pointsets.<br>
Unlike most of our competitors, our methods consisted purely of discrete, algorithmic solutions. The way in which they compared yielded some interesting observations.
