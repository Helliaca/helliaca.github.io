With the rising popularity of standalone, mobile VR headsets, cognitive studies are more difficult to run, since the experimenter cannot control or see the view of the participant.
RCAS (Remote-Control-And-Streaming) is a Unity framework intended to enable remote control of an application running on a remote mobile VR headset in addition to live-streaming the VR view.
Developed as a freelance project for the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, it is lightweight and allows for an image to be streamed from a mobile VR headset to a phone or other device in addition to allowing the experimented to control the experiment through RCE as well as retrieved any data recorded on the headset.
