The Runners Study is in many ways similar to the 'Statues' or 'Red Light, Green Light' games. Four animated monsters advance on the participant at different speeds. By using eye-tracking, the participant can stop one of these monsters by looking at it. The monsters have different colors and patterns, which correlate with a monster's speed. 
The purpose of the study is to investigate whether embedding the learning process in performing instrumental actions, where all the relationships they need to learn about are always visible to them, can help with the learning of cue-outcome relationships in young children.
