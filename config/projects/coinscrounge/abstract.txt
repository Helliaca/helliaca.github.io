As a semi-followup to our <a href="https://benjamin.kahl.fi/build/projects/producerscrounger/detailed.html" alt="link to producerScrounger">ProducerScroungers in Minecraft study</a>, CoinScrounge seeks to model the cognitive processes governing dynamically-interacting individuals in human collectives under realistic conditions.
For this purpose, I built a Unity-based 3D multiplayer game where four players use a metal detector to search a field of grass for coins, under varying conditions.
The end result was one of the most complex and complete multiplayer-projects I've worked on, including a large amount of custom-written netcode. The final manuscript has been accepted for publication in <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">nature communications</a>.
