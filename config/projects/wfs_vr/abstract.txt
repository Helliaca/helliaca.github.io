Wave field synthesis (WFS) is an extremely unique, but powerful audio rendering technique that creates virtual acoustic environments by simulating sound waves. I had the rare opportunity of utilizing this technology and build a complete VR study with it to assess it's advantages and challenges.

After multiple attempts and prototypes, the resulting product ended up one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly VR applications I've created. By leveraging hand-tracking and AI-generated audio instructions, it gently eases the participants into the task with a minimal learning curve.
