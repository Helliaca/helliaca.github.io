Wave field synthesis (WFS) is an audio rendering technique that creates virtual acoustic environments by simulating sound waves. Loudspeaker arrays synthesize artificial wavefronts that seem to originate from a given start-point by super-imposing a large set of individual, elementary sound-waves.

As an initial stepping-stone, I sought to combine WFS into a simple VR-based experiment that measures how accurately participants perceive the origin-points of artificial wavefronts. Further points of interest include (but are not limited to) which factors affect localization-accuracy, which advantages and limitations WFS systems have over their more accessible counterparts, and which type of studies would benefit most from itâ€™s integration.
