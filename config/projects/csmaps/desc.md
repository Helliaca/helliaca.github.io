## CSGO Maps

I've always been a big fan of the games made by Valve, and have frequently dabbled and experimented with modding and mapping for Source-Engine games. This includes a range of CS:GO maps that range from highly detailed to complete gimmicks.

Here's an overview of some of them:

**de_clickspring:** A bomb-defusal map with volumetric lighting and a vintage steampunk aesthetic and a plethora of self-made models.

**cs_research:** A very large hostage-rescue map with rideable vehicles, many different interconnected areas and a secret easter egg!

**es_prison_escape:** A custom gamemode that incorporates class-based combat, procedurally changing levels and a custom win-condition. It's found a lot of favour as a 1v1 map in particular and has accumulated well over 1400 subscribers.

**fy_schoolconspiracy:** On the surface just a regular map of a school building, but by unlocking several secrets and solving some environmental puzzles, the player can enter a hidden "world domination room" and launch a missile. 200+ subscribers.

## CS 1.6 Maps

Back in ancient dinosaur-times, when I was still a teenager, I loved creating maps for CS 1.6. I made a long series of maps that ranged all the way from competitive multiplayer, to utterly absurd, experimental gimmicks such as a "Quidditch" map (don't ask). There is a total of 23 maps, and many of them had a secret easter-egg "world domination room" hidden inside them. See below for an overview of my favorites!
