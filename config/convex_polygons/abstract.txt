A convex partition of a pointset consists of a planar subdivision of its convex hull so that all faces are empty and convex.  Finding a partition with the minimum amount of edges (or faces), is still a problem of unknown complexity. <br>
As part of the CG:SHOP 2020 competition we devised a set of four different algorithms to compute various convex partitions for differently arranged pointsets.<br>
Here we outline the implementation of each of them in tandem with our central findings on how they perform
