# Soft-Matter-Vis
Visualizing Concepts from Soft Matter Simulation such as Gaussian Chains and Random Walk Model with Unity3d

## Available Commands
- `genchain X`: Generate a single Gaussian chain of length X

- `genchain X Y`: Generate X Gaussian chains of length Y

- `calc gyr/R2`: Calculate and display the Gyration Radius or Avg. polymer size for the last set of chain(s) generated

- `toggle gyr/R2`: Toggle visibility of Gyration Radius or Avg. polymer size if they have been calculated

- `clear`: Clear all chains and radii currently in the scene.

## Examples:

Single Gaussian Chain l=100
